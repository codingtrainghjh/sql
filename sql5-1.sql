--GROUP 함수의 기본 사용
SELECT AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary), SUM(salary)
FROM   employees;
SELECT AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary), SUM(salary)
FROM   employees
WHERE  department_id = 60;
SELECT MIN(last_name), MAX(last_name)
FROM employees;
SELECT MIN(hire_date), MAX(hire_date)
FROM employees;
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(department_id), COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) --count 함수만 *나 distinct를 허용함
FROM employees;
SELECT AVG(commission_pct), AVG(NVL(commission_pct, 0))
FROM employees;
--GROUP BY 절의 사용
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees;
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY 1;
SELECT department_id, job_id,  SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id, job_id
ORDER BY 1,2;
SELECT department_id, job_id,  SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE department_id >= 50
GROUP BY department_id, job_id
ORDER BY 1,2;
--HAVING 절의 사용
SELECT department_id,job_id,  SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE COUNT(*) <> 1 -- where절에는 그룹함수가 조건으로 들어갈 수 없음
GROUP BY department_id, job_id
ORDER BY 1,2;
SELECT department_id,job_id,  SUM(salary), COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE department_id <> 90
GROUP BY department_id, job_id
HAVING COUNT(*) <> 1 --having 절은 group절 없이 나올 수 없음
ORDER BY 1,2;
--GROUP 함수의 중첩
SELECT MAX(SUM(salary))
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
SELECT department_id, MAX(SUM(salary))
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
